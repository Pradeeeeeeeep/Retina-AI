# Dataset provenance

Recorded on 2026-08-22 from the archives and extracted files present in `data/raw/`.

The actual download time was not recorded, so the date below is the local filesystem creation date of each archive.

Archive file counts exclude directory entries and count only archive members that are files.

Archive size is the exact byte size of the archive, and SHA-256 is computed over the archive itself.

No image pixels were modified before extraction or use.

## APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection

- Source URL: [Kaggle competition data page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aptos2019-blindness-detection/data).
- Download date: 2026-08-22 based on local filesystem metadata; the original download log is unavailable.
- Licence or usage conditions: Kaggle marks the data as subject to the competition rules, and the archive contains no standalone licence file.
- Number of files: 5,593 archive files, comprising 3,662 labelled training images, 1,928 public test images, and three CSV files.
- Archive size: 10,215,289,875 bytes.
- SHA-256: `18036845ab76b68d305d6e2dbbaaaf5cd23926be740e1297a8972ac1c6360976`.
- Labels available: `train.csv` provides image-level severity labels 0 to 4, named No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferative DR; the public test images are unlabelled.
- Intended project role: Primary training, validation, calibration, and internal test data because it is an Indian dataset and the closest available proxy for the intended deployment setting.
- Patient identifier note: The supplied metadata has only `id_code` and `diagnosis`, with no patient or examination identifier.

The fixed split files therefore use each unique APTOS `id_code` as a conservative `patient_id` surrogate.

This proves separation of all supplied identifiers, but a stronger bilateral-eye patient guarantee would require patient metadata from the dataset provider.

## MESSIDOR-2 DR Grades metadata

- Source URL: [Google Brain MESSIDOR-2 DR Grades data card](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/google-brain/messidor2-dr-grades).
- Download date: 2026-08-22 based on local filesystem metadata; the original download log is unavailable.
- Licence or usage conditions: The Kaggle data card lists the grade metadata as CC0 Public Domain and the included README requests citation of Krause et al. (2018).
- Number of files: 2 archive files, `messidor_data.csv` and `messidor_readme.txt`.
- Archive size: 7,531 bytes.
- SHA-256: `84809fc59541313be6cf57ed9209516eaf5a1514949669eed72dc9561917021d`.
- Labels available: Adjudicated five-point ICDR grades, referable DME grades, and gradability flags for the MESSIDOR-2 image identifiers.
- Intended project role: Metadata for the sealed external evaluation only.

This archive contains grade metadata, not the official MESSIDOR-2 image release.

It is excluded from all development split files, and no contents of the grade CSV were read while cataloguing or moving this archive.

### Move under seal, recorded 2026-08-22

This archive and its extracted contents were downloaded to `data/raw/messidor2-dr-grades.zip` and `data/raw/messidor2_grades/` (unsealed), where they had been sitting exposed to the working tree rather than access-controlled as §10.4 requires.

On 2026-08-22 the following were moved, unread, to bring them under the seal:

- `data/raw/messidor2-dr-grades.zip` &rarr; `data/sealed/messidor2-dr-grades.zip`
- `data/raw/messidor2_grades/messidor_data.csv` &rarr; `data/sealed/messidor2_grades/messidor_data.csv`
- `data/raw/messidor2_grades/messidor_readme.txt` &rarr; `data/sealed/messidor2_grades/messidor_readme.txt`

The grade CSV's contents were not read or opened as part of this move, consistent with §10.4: development uses train / validation / calibration only, and the sealed set is opened once, by the named key-holder, after the operating point is frozen and dated.

`data/raw/` no longer contains any Messidor-2 material.

A regression test, `tests/TestSealedDataProtection.m`, asserts this and asserts that the pipeline's existing sealed-path guards (in `app.runScreeningCase`, `explain.gradcam`, `grade.fitTemperature`, and `report.generate`) reject paths under `data/sealed/`.

### MESSIDOR-2 image set, recorded 2026-09-01

The image release is obtained separately from ADCIS and had never had a checksum recorded.

That omission is why previously reported sealed-set numbers could not be shown to be reproducible on a new machine.

A replacement copy was obtained on 2026-09-01 and its checksums are recorded here so the gap does not recur.

- Supplied as four split parts, `IMAGES.zip.001` through `IMAGES.zip.004`.
- Combined size: 2,455,185,147 bytes.
- Combined SHA-256, over `cat IMAGES.zip.001 IMAGES.zip.002 IMAGES.zip.003 IMAGES.zip.004`: `bf665275db889e1f6d68641fae1bc074a62ec1a5083637c902dc309cd95f99e9`.

| Part | Bytes | SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| `IMAGES.zip.001` | 734,003,200 | `f5ee401078ab2a857744d30571155829e6f79aa321aa2900aa4e1d825082d5d3` |
| `IMAGES.zip.002` | 734,003,200 | `54d8ba72d07e7842e7abf3304b50d4aa4b5afc48fc47baf2158d6ce700ab5c17` |
| `IMAGES.zip.003` | 734,003,200 | `b4ae5052a557edb33184ac92176906745a28fdb573a347fcd662e123820ee030` |
| `IMAGES.zip.004` | 253,175,547 | `7bc91ae9a9cda42c1fda22c9fb65ccd32f176292975bd77c330d63fa15e23eac` |

The combined hash matches the 16-character prefix `bf665275db889e1f` that the migration log recorded for the original `IMAGES.zip`.

This copy is therefore the same image set the earlier sealed evaluation ran on.

Consistent with S10.4, no archive member was extracted or read while recording these hashes.

An accompanying `messidor-2.csv` (38,423 bytes) was supplied alongside the parts and was moved under seal unread.

It is not the same file as `messidor2_grades/messidor_data.csv`, which comes from the Kaggle grade-metadata archive.

## APTOS class distribution

The counts below were independently recomputed from `data/raw/aptos2019/train.csv` with MATLAB using the `diagnosis` column.

The exact total is 3,662 labelled training images.

| ICDR level | Label | Count | Exact share | Rounded share |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | No DR | 1,805 | 1805 / 3662 = 49.29000546% | 49.29% |
| 1 | Mild | 370 | 370 / 3662 = 10.10376843% | 10.10% |
| 2 | Moderate | 999 | 999 / 3662 = 27.28017477% | 27.28% |
| 3 | Severe | 193 | 193 / 3662 = 5.27034407% | 5.27% |
| 4 | Proliferative DR | 295 | 295 / 3662 = 8.05570726% | 8.06% |
| **Total** |  | **3,662** | **100%** | **100%** |

The five counts sum to 3,662.

## Extraction layout

Every archive except APTOS unpacks directly into `data/raw/` rather than into a per-dataset subdirectory.

The split files in `data/splits/` hard-code these paths and `src/+grade/private/loadSplitData.m` asserts on them, so extracting to a tidier layout silently breaks the splits.

| Archive | Unpacks to |
|---|---|
| `aptos2019-blindness-detection.zip` | `data/raw/aptos2019/`. The archive root holds `train_images/`, `test_images/` and three CSVs, so it must be extracted into a directory named `aptos2019`. |
| `A. Segmentation.zip` | `data/raw/A. Segmentation/` |
| `B. Disease Grading.zip` | `data/raw/B. Disease Grading/` |
| `C. Localization.zip` | `data/raw/C. Localization/` |
| `DRIVE.zip` | Holds `training.zip` and `test.zip`, which unpack to `data/raw/training/` and `data/raw/test/`. The vessel splits draw both train and test frames from `data/raw/training/`. |

## Reproduction commands

```bash
sha256sum data/raw/*.zip
```

The extracted directories are working copies of the archive contents.

No resizing, relabelling, image enhancement, or other preprocessing was applied while creating this provenance record.
