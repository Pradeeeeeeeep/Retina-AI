#
# Running MATLAB as a background job and terminating it from a trap is what
# makes Ctrl+C actually stop the demo. Descendants are signalled too: MATLAB
# spawns helper and renderer processes that outlive a bare kill of the parent.

  LESION EVIDENCE CHANNEL
    Live in this demo                {live}
    Learned channel, all four heads  sensitivity 1.0000 / specificity 0.0000  (A6)
    Learned channel, exudates only   sensitivity 0.8072 / specificity 0.8257  (A8)

  The learned channel is the better localiser (4.87x pointing game vs 1.32x
  for Grad-CAM) and was still unusable as ICDR evidence until its thresholds
  were re-selected on the calibration split. Restricting it to its one
  trustworthy head fixed the channel and barely moved the pipeline, which
  looked like the channel's fault and was not: the agreement check was
  escalating it for reaching ICDR Level 2 at all. Repairing that (A10,
  adopted 31 August 2026) took autonomous coverage from 0.0691 to 0.3273
  with zero referable patients sent home. Both numbers are reported.
